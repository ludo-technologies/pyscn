# pyqol Configuration File
# This is an example configuration file showing all available options

# Complexity analysis configuration
complexity:
  # Threshold for low complexity (inclusive)
  # Functions with complexity <= low_threshold are considered low risk
  low_threshold: 9
  
  # Threshold for medium complexity (inclusive)  
  # Functions with complexity > low_threshold and <= medium_threshold are medium risk
  # Functions with complexity > medium_threshold are high risk
  medium_threshold: 19
  
  # Whether to enable complexity analysis
  enabled: true
  
  # Whether to report functions with complexity = 1 (unchanged functions)
  report_unchanged: true
  
  # Maximum allowed complexity before failing analysis (0 = no limit)
  # If set > 0, analysis will fail if any function exceeds this value
  max_complexity: 0

# Output formatting configuration
output:
  # Output format: text, json, yaml, csv
  format: text
  
  # Whether to show detailed breakdown of complexity metrics

  # How to sort results: name, complexity, risk

  # Minimum complexity to report (filters out low-complexity functions)

# File analysis configuration
